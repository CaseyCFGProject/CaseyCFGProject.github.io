<!-- Content -->
  <div class="transbox">
    <p>This section of the Fife Coastal Path is 16 miles (25.8 km) long through some wonderful scenic areas. Allow 6 - 7 hours.

    ​It takes in the Tentsmuir National Nature Reserve and passes through the beautiful Tayport village and finally arrives at Wormit Bay after passing the Tay Road Bridge.

    The section from Guardbridge to Tentsmuir skirts the military base and into Leuchars with its fine 12th century Romanesque church. The route passes the privately owned Earlshall Castle and crosses Earlshall Muir, the last remnant of the once extensive wild dunelands that dominated this coast until the early 1920’s and the advent of commercial forestry.

    Boardwalks cross the old marshlands leading into Tentsmuir Point National Nature Reserve, home to a diverse variety of wildlife including birds, bats, red squirrels, seals and butterflies. From Tentsmuir the trail parallels the coast passing a large ice house, once used to store salmon, you are now en route through the Tentsmuir Forest Forestry Commission National Nature Reserve.

    Once the path drops out of the forest and onto Tayport Heath, there are great views across the river to Broughty Ferry Castle, head on to Tayport and follow the tarmac disused railway line to the Tay Bridge. 

    The Tay Bridge to Wormit Bay section is easy walking along pavements and runs along the sparsely populated North Coast of Fife. The landscape and resulting land use in this part of Fife are quite different from the rest of the county.</p>
