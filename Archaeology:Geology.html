		<h1> Archaeology & Geology </h1>

		<p> <b> Fife is awash with archaeological sites that give us a glimpse into the lives of the people who have lived and worked along Fife's coast.  The rugged coastline has been formed from a time when Fife was covered with active volacnoes and tropical swamps. </b> </p>
		
		<p>Fife possesses a rich variety of archaeological remains, which are a physical record of thousands of years of human development and activity from when hunter gatherers roamed this area around 9000 years ago. </p>

		<p>All along the coastline and throughout the Kindgom you will find yourself catching a glimpse of standing stones in a perfectly ploughed field, or coming across the remnants of once grand ruinious churches and chapels. </p>

		<p> In geological terms, the rock formations and fossil sites round the Coastal Path are a wonder to explore from Buddo Rock to the giant centipede fossil tracks near the shore in Crail.</p>

				<p> The Fife Costal Path crosses Starley Burn over a pedestrian bridge. The waterfall which falls into it is around 12 to 15 ft above the path and the interesting coating on the nerby stones is caused by the lime rich water </p>
